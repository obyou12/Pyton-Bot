# Pyton-Bot

This program is going to web scraping a website, "NewEgg," to find multiple GPU like Geforce RTX 3080. Since the GPU cards are rare to find, it would be nice to check the website by itself and added to cart. As right now, it would be just find Geforce RTX3080 GPUs only. Later on, I would like to build a Bot can buy GPUs by itself.
